<H2>Welcome to the Spring Boot MongoDB Application! This project is a starter template for a Spring Boot application connected to MongoDB. It's simple, fast, and easy to get up and running.<H2>

Prerequisites
Java 17 or later
Gradle 7.0+ (or use the Gradle wrapper provided in the project)
MongoDB installed and running locally

<H2>STEPS  TO BUILD:</H2>
- git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
- cd your-repo-name
- ./gradlew build
- ./gradlew bootRun

<H2>Accessing the Application</H2>
Once the application is running, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:8084 in your web browser. All APIs and services are available through this port.


<br>
**Note:** Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible. If you don't have MongoDB installed locally, don't worry! I can provide a cloud-based MongoDB link in privateâ€”just reach out! The link is very secure so i will give it in private because of the credentials and options connection.

<H2>API to try:</H2>

- httP://localhost:8084/books/store (Post) 
- httP://localhost:8084/books/search (Get)
